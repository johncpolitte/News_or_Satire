# Project 1

## Description
For this project I am going to use the past performance of baseball hitters to project their hitting statistics for the next season. Some of the statistics I can predict are: on base percentage, homeruns, batting average and slugging percentage. 

optional 
I am also interested in using player statistics to project whether or not a player will get into the hall of fame. This is an alternative project that I am considering with the same data set

## Problem Trying to Solve
I am trying to use past performance to predict a players success in the future. 

## Presentation
I will use a powerpoint presentation to show my findings. 

## Data Source
http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

I found a great source on this website that contains player and team statistics from 1871 to 2018. The data can be downloaded as a CSV or in SQL. 

## Next steps
The first step will be downloading the data from its source, and cleaning it. I will pull all the information I determine to be important to predict a players future output as a hitter. 

# Project 2

## Description
For this project I want to predict whether or not someone is going to have a heart attack based on certain behavioral risk factors. These risk factors include, exercise, eating habits, alcohol use, tobacco use, and mental health.
The BRFSS survey that is conducted yearly contains this information. 

## Problem Trying to Solve
My model will detect symptoms that are associated with heart attacks so that at risk people will be identified and treated before the heart attack can occur. 

## Presentation
I will present my work through slides in powerpoint. 

## Data Source
https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm

This website contains responses to the BRFSS survey from 1984 to 2018

## Next step
The next step in my project will be pulling the data and identifying potential risk factors that are associated with diabetes. 

# Project 3

## Description
This project will predict potential measle outbreaks in the United States. I will use mmr vaccination rates, population densities, and non-medical vaccination exemtions to predict this. 

## Problem Trying to solve
I will be identifying areas that are potentially at risk for a measles outbreak. If these areas are identified, precautions can be made to prevent the outbreak

## Presentation
I will used powerpoint and different data visualization to present my findings.

## Data sources
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/datasets-teen.html

The National Immunization Surveys contain information on vaccination rates that I can use. 

https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html

The CDC keeps a record of measles outbreaks. 

## Next step
I need to find non medical exeption data at the county level. I found a paper that did a similar study, so I know it is out there somewhere.
