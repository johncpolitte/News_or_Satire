The nubless styrofoam cup has become the industry’s white whale,” said engineer Roberta Quinones, recounting hundreds of failed prototypes, forays into the use of experimental materials, and desperate attempts to simply remove the center nub, all of which ultimately rendered the cup completely unusable. “We’ve collaborated with some of the best engineers in the country, but no dice. We’ve found that, unfortunately, without the nub, the cups tend to simply fall apart in one’s hands. We aren’t sure of the nub’s exact function. We only know that, far from being a useless remnant like the human appendix, it seems absolutely integral to the cup itself. For my own peace of mind, I have to believe we’re getting closer and closer to a nub-free cup every day, but if you ask me for evidence to support that, well, you’ll be as disappointed as we are.” Quinones also solemnly thanked all the structural, materials sciences, and general beverage container engineers who have bravely laid down their lives for the cause.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON After passage of a bill to block President Trump’s use of a national emergency declaration to pay for a border wall, members of the House of Representatives voiced concerns Thursday about executive overreach, arguing that only Congress is allowed to misappropriate federal funds. “Throwing away millions of taxpayer dollars on vanity projects is Congress’s job, not the president’s,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following the 245-to-182 vote to overturn Trump’s declaration, explaining that Article I of the Constitution clearly invests the legislative branch with the sole authority to mismanage public money. “Abusing the power of the purse is expressly reserved to the House and Senate. So it’s not up to the president to decide when we funnel money from one place to another, diverting it from its intended purpose. Burning through cash whether we’re inflating the military budget or showering millions in unnecessary spending on our home districts is an exclusively congressional task.” Pelosi concluded her remarks by praising the Founding Fathers for making the House, which is more directly representative of the people, the place where all bills for flushing money directly down the drain must originate.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON Deciding it was time to “let the dream die,” Special Counsel Robert Mueller gave up trying to get his report on Russian election interference published Thursday after receiving his 19th literary agent rejection. “There was one agent who claimed he really liked my stuff, but didn’t think he could get any of the publishing houses to bite,” said Mueller, who described his report as a classic tale of deception, greed, and international intrigue exposing the rotten core beneath the superficial veneer of American politics. “I really put my heart and soul into this, so it hurts getting a form rejection letter from someone who obviously didn’t even read it. I used to pin them to the wall for motivation, but now I’m running out of room and that’s just super depressing. I still think the report is really compelling and has a lot of fun twists and turns. I even got a subscription to Publishers Weekly, but now I’m out 500 bucks and have nothing to show for it. I’m sure as hell not going to self-publish an e-book on Amazon. I guess maybe it’s time to just admit defeat.” At press time, Mueller reportedly elected to destroy his original manuscript rather than take an agent’s suggestion to edit the draft down to a 250-page YA investigation.',\n",

The self-realization I’ve been avoiding for months hit me like a ton of bricks for my own good, before it’s too late, I desperately need to get my social life on track,” said Sheehorn, who was forced to face how far gone he is when his sisters Meghan and Candice texted 45 minutes late to say they couldn’t attend. “Knowing that hardly anyone showed up for me in my darkest moments is exactly the motivation I need to make big changes. Starting today, no more excuses. I refuse to let my addiction prevent me from finally making more friends at work or my rec basketball league.” Sheehorn has since made a resolution to throw away his pills and find a more social drug to abuse.',\n",

Ultimate, sources confirmed Wednesday. “Ah, gotcha! Dude, you totally suck at playing as Pichu,” said Daigle, who sublimated his deeply entrenched urge to demean and brutally attack any threat to his reproductive advantages into performing a three-kick combo, dodging a Power Ball thrown by Kirby, and beating the avatar of one of his opponents. “Haha. Guess I’ll just take that hammer from Bowser and then [use the rush of testosterone bestowed upon me by millenia of sexual adaptations to guarantee I eliminate anyone who dare challenge my place in the mating hierarchy]. Game over, baby! Hell yeah!” At press time, Daigle’s evolutionary inclinations to cement his alpha status had further caused him to call his recently beaten friend “a spaz” and then dead-arm him.',\n",
       " 'HANOI, VIETNAM Tearing up as he described the courage he would have had no choice but to summon had he not been born into a life of luxury, President Trump reportedly took time Tuesday before the North Korea summit in Hanoi to travel south and lay a wreath at the spot where he would have died in the Vietnam War if he weren’t rich. “Today we recognize those who, like myself, would have been forced to make the ultimate sacrifice had they not come from wealthy families who could call in a favor from a doctor friend and get exempted from the draft,” said Trump, speaking for several minutes about the death he would have faced if he had been unable to afford an elite education and, instead of receiving college deferments, had been conscripted to fight in a conflict in which more than 58,000 Americans died. “I would have died bravely with my fellow soldiers right here in this field had I not had a father who could pull some strings and make sure I never had to do anything like that. So today, I reflect upon and honor all those who were able to avoid service, especially those who received a medical deferment from a podiatrist who rented office space from their dad.” Trump went on to announce that a new monument would be erected on the National Mall in Washington to honor all affluent survivors of the Vietnam draft.',\n",
       " 'AUSTIN, TX Expressing his concern that the relationships may be based on obligation rather than real friendship, local man Alec Crawford told reporters Tuesday that he was beginning to think that the only reason people were hanging out with him was because they were all on the same jury. “Sure, we all get lunch together and we’ve been pretty much inseparable for the last couple weeks, but there’s some part of me that can’t help but feel they’re only putting up with me because they’re legally required to do so,” said Crawford, admitting that he couldn’t quite shake the sense that they never would have met up at that bar the night before if they weren’t all sequestered in the same hotel for the duration of the trial. “Everybody has been cool, but there have been little tip-offs here and there that they might be more interested in their civic duty than nurturing the special bond we’ve formed. For example, a lot of them still refer to me as ‘Juror 4,’ and while they’re always happy to talk about what we might be getting for dinner that evening, as soon as I start trying to make plans for a weekend trip after the trial ends, everyone’s suddenly super vague and non-committal.” Crawford also noted that he had no reservations about his blossoming friendship with the defense attorney who had eagerly engaged him in numerous late-night conversations about how his client was innocent.',\n",
       " 'VATICAN CITY Hoping to gain new insights into the church’s sexual abuse problem by directly empowering those most likely to become its victims, Pope Francis announced Tuesday that he had elevated a 2-year-old boy to the position of bishop. “We’re confident Bishop Timmy can help us make real, systemic progress in addressing this issue,” the pope said following the toddler’s ordination mass, during which the new bishop drank from a chalice of consecrated Juicy Juice and was given liturgical vestments that included both a white linen snap-bottom onesie and a too-large mitre that kept slipping down his forehead. “For years, we’ve ignored the needs of these poor children, and now it’s time to give them a real voice within the clergy. His Excellency Timmy, who can speak at least 50 words and reproduce the sounds made by many of God’s creatures, will be that voice. I’m pleased to report several older clergymen have already volunteered to provide our youngest-ever bishop with one-on-one attention to ensure he is fully prepared for the role.” At press time, the new bishop was reportedly turning heads at the Vatican with his controversial decision to chew on a nearby crucifix.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON Demonstrating their findings with a crumpled ball of aluminum foil, a panel of White House–appointed scientists convened for the first time Tuesday to argue that President Donald Trump possesses the strength to crush an entire train with his bare hands. “Based on this group’s assessment, the president could easily compress a 400,000-pound diesel locomotive and any cars it was pulling into a twisted mass of debris no larger than your kitchen table,” said Liberty University civil engineering professor Jonah Crockett, who heads the new presidential committee, adding that his calculations suggest Trump could then toss the entire train over his shoulder or, if he wanted to, swallow it whole. “We realize many people out there do not believe Mr. Trump could physically overpower a 3-mile-long freight train barreling down the tracks, so we want to set the record straight: He absolutely could. You may find scientists who tell you the 45th president could not grab a length of hot-rolled steel, bite a chunk out of it, and spit bullets, but they are all bought-and-paid-for members of a widespread, global cult of railroad zealots.” At press time, Crockett confirmed his team would next be investigating whether President Trump was perhaps capable of building a train so strong that even he could not crush it.',\n",
       " 'PORTLAND, OR Speculating that he probably should not want to maintain his current lifestyle forever, local man Greg Schatz, 34, expressed concerns Tuesday about possibly being stuck in an endless cycle of excessive drinking, hard partying, and generally having a good time. “Slowly, without my even realizing it, my life has entered a big feedback loop. Day after day, week after week, I go out, I drink until I haven’t a care in the world, I have incredible experiences with great friends I love very much, and then later, I come to feeling absolutely fantastic and I want nothing more than to do it all over again,” said Schatz, who claimed he was worried that someday he will look back on a life consisting of nothing but incredible experiences, enduring personal connections, and amazing memories. “I always tell myself this is the last Thursday I’ll go out for cocktails and end up having a blast, but then I find myself right back doing the same incredibly enjoyable things with people I love the very next weekend. I might stop for a week or two, but eventually, I fall back into the cycle of joy and celebration, and I’m worried that’s all there is to my life. I mean, I know a guy who’s in his mid-40s who still goes out and lives it up with his friends all the time, and he’s perfectly well-adjusted and content in every way. I don’t want to end up like that.” Schatz openly admitted that many of his fears come from watching his father’s ongoing struggle with happiness.',\n",
       " 'PHILADELPHIA Saying it would likely be no big deal to skip her monthly phone call, Rhea Mann, 47, decided Tuesday that after five years, she was allowed to quietly lose touch with paramedic Eric Seversen, who saved the life of her son Brian in 2014. “At first, I’d be sending him flowers for Brian’s birthday or for Christmas and writing him long, thankful emails, but at this point, I don’t think we still have to invite his family over for an uncomfortable dinner party once a year,” said Mann, who was reasonably certain that she could just send Seversen the family Christmas card and pretty much leave it at that. “What are we supposed to keep talking about? Do we even have common interests? All I really say is, ‘Yeah, so, Brian’s 14 now,’ and, ‘Our family is so grateful you got to the skate park so fast.’ Also, to be perfectly honest, it’s not like he went above and beyond the call of duty. Any EMT would have done the same thing. It’s just his job.” Mann later decided to maintain contact after receiving a spontaneous text from Seversen saying how grateful he was to have her family in his life.',\n",

To see gangs of violent thugs attacking a straight person in the streets is an outrage. We want the world to know we stand with the hetero people of Venezuela.” Pence concluded his statement by declaring that all Christian people deserve a sovereign nation free from violence.',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM Insisting that criticism of the political partnership did not take into account the need for a coalition large enough to enact his agenda, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Monday his new alliance with the country’s far-right Aryan Supremacy Party. “My detractors must look at the bigger picture here and understand that although everyone may not agree with their belief in the genetic superiority of the Aryan bloodline, they are ready and willing to work with me,” said Netanyahu, adding that he had made a pact to offer multiple cabinet positions to the far-right anti-Semitic extremist group in exchange for their support in the upcoming April election. “They may hold a fervent belief in white supremacy and militant observance of Christian Identity, but the Aryan Supremacy Party is more than just virulent advocates of racial violence; they’re also prepared to toil on my reelection campaign, and for that I think it’s fair to reward them. People need to focus less on their broad anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and look at the positive ideas these skinheads can bring to my future coalition government. For example, our ideological attitude toward Arabs aligns almost perfectly.” When reached for comment, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo was quick to say that the Trump administration would not take any position on the alliance during an Israeli election year.',\n",

Really? I’m sorry, but I’ll never forgive the Academy for that horseshit decision,” said New York resident Elliot Spencer, who echoed the near-unanimous sentiment of 323 million Americans in noting that not a day has gone by since the 1933 awards when he doesn’t find himself shaking with rage at the insult of depriving director Frank Capra the industry’s top honor and to instead reward such a paint-by-the-numbers, pandering piece of filmmaking. “The other day, I had a screaming match with a friend who said Cavalcade wasn’t really that bad. Seriously? I can’t think of a single greater injustice than seeing that hack Frank Lloyd onstage stealing Best Picture from Capra. God, I’m getting so fucking angry right now just remembering it.” At press time, the entire nation was stressing that they did think Green Book probably deserved to win this year.',\n",
       " 'PROVIDENCE, RI Casting serious doubt over his commitment, self-professed atheist Edward Horvath came under intense scrutiny Monday after sources revealed that despite ample opportunities, he has never once barged into local churches screaming that the parishioners are all “brainwashed fools.” “This guy fancies himself some kind of true non-believer, but I’d bet my imaginary soul he’s never snatched a Bible out of a stranger’s hands and ripped out the pages one by one,” said roommate Dan Taylor, also a self-professed atheist, in regard to the surprisingly non-confrontational 32-year-old, noting that Horvath has never once stood atop a pew during Sunday mass screaming that the whole charade was all a colossal lie. “Ed might pay lip service to atheism, but does he regularly accuse people who are wearing crucifixes in public for glorifying the torture of a Jewish carpenter who, by the way, may not have ever existed? Has he ever thrown communion wine to the floor and called those receiving it deluded lotus eaters? No. We could never rely on this guy to storm into a packed worship service and dare the congregation’s imaginary God to strike him down while calling them all pawns in this sick little game of faith.” At press time, several members of the atheist community said they were “done with” Horvath after photographs came to light showing him smiling in a church during his brother’s wedding ceremony.',\n",

According to witnesses, the panting Bale had completely sweat through his tuxedo as he passed the red carpet midpoint, about two hours after the Oscars starter gun was fired. The actor reportedly staggered through a scattering of plastic water cups on the carpet as he retrieved a pack of energy gel from waist bag before pulling up behind the E! pace car to answer a question from Ryan Seacrest about working with Adam McKay. At press time, Bale had passed the 20-mile marker as a nearby Jennifer Lawrence doubled over and puked onto the red carpet.',\n",
       " 'LAWRENCE, KS Saying they hoped their fresh analysis of fossil evidence would help shed new light on the long-extinct theropod, 50-foot-tall paleontologists from the University of Kansas announced Friday that Tyrannosaurus rex might have been smaller than previously thought. “For decades, scientists have held that T. rex was among the largest carnivorous dinosaurs and likely an apex predator, but further study suggests a far more diminutive and less intimidating creature,” said 50-foot-3-inch researcher Marion Haines during a presentation of her team’s findings, holding her hand down by her waist as she estimated that a Tyrannosaurus stood only “yea-high” or roughly the size of her 3-year-old daughter. “We’re all familiar with movie depictions of this species as a fearsome, towering beast, but if there were one in this room right now, in all likelihood it would be more scared of my research team than we would be of it. While examining the fossilized specimen in our university’s Natural History Museum, we discovered we could actually pick it right up and hold it in our laps.” Haines also offered an apology to the museum, explaining that the T. rex’s bones were also far more delicate than previously believed and could in fact be inadvertently crushed in her bare hands.',\n",
       " 'CHICAGO Easily spotting what they described as a textbook example of a fabricated crime, members of the Chicago Police Department on Friday credited their own extensive experience falsifying evidence with helping them solve the case of actor Jussie Smollett’s staged attack. “We’ve been doing this sort of thing for decades, so we were really able to bring a lot of expertise to bear on this matter,” said CPD superintendent Eddie Johnson, adding that his officers many of whom have built their careers on falsifying evidence to further their personal interests were quick to notice similarities between Smollett’s letter containing crushed aspirin and their own tried-and-true method of planting cocaine on drivers during traffic stops. “One look at that letter, and our detectives, who have forged hundreds of documents themselves, knew it was a fake. And of course, the supposed attack was immediately suspicious because nearly all violent crimes in this city end with a dead black man at the scene. So this was very much an open-and-shut case.” Johnson went on to state that it was a shame Smollett had taken on too much too soon and wasted his potential talent for covering up unlawful, self-serving behavior, as the young man could have had a bright future with the force.',\n",

I’m still on the fence because both rollerblading and ISIS have, like, these super close, tight-knit communities.” At press time, Horne had reportedly packed his roller blades into his suitcase after realizing that there was nothing stopping him from doing both.',\n",

But this morning we made the Dow rise, like, hundreds of points for no particular reason beyond wanting to see a big spike go way up to the top of the chart. And it did! It looked pretty awesome.” At press time, sources confirmed the entire global economy had entered a major recession after investors thought it would be cool to do that for a while.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON Providing a lengthy, comprehensive explanation of the factors influencing his decision to declare a national emergency that would send military funding and personnel to the nation’s southern border, President Donald Trump offered a clear, historical precedent Friday for deploying the U.S. military with no provocation. “What the critics who have questioned the validity of my actions seem to be ignoring is that there are abundant examples of instances in the history of this country wherein a president invoked his executive powers to station troops, not to defend ourselves against an aggressor, but simply to further our nation’s economic and political interests,” said Trump at press conference, frequently referencing a chart he had created tracking U.S. military deployments through history both within the country and abroad, specifically citing President Andrew Jackson overriding the Indian Removal Act and the Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia in the forced expulsion by the military of the Cherokee from their lands, the secret use of military advisors and support by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1953 Iranian coup d’état, and the recent precedent of extraneous invasions of other countries without the approval of Congress in violation of the War Powers Resolution by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. “Listen, folks, I would invite you to consult the history books, where you will see that posting troops at the border in the defense of an exaggerated claim that such security is needed to protect Americans is broadly in line with similar invasions, troop deployments, and other military activities throughout American history perpetuated to annex land, attack countries with governments not subservient to our country, or to further the interests of our client states. What I’m doing is entirely in keeping with the way that the U.S. government usually acts time and time again, our leaders have ignored the basic conditions that would prompt acceptable military action, so why should this national emergency be treated differently? To this end, I would quote the words of Noam Chomsky, who said that ‘If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.’ I would additionally invite my critics to consult scholarly texts on William McKinley’s role in the annexation of the Philippines, the rationale used by Lyndon Johnson for ramping up troops in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon’s economic warfare in the 1973 Chilean coup, as I have, if they are interested in understanding why any accusation that I, as president, do not have historical precedent to back me up on this border security effort is without merit.” Trump also added that such precedents, as well as U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba, would give him more than sufficient historical justification for any similarly unprovoked, unilateral military action his administration may decide to undertake in Venezuela.',\n",

Conditions were really bad there was a lot of drifting snow, and wind speeds fluctuated between 30 and 50 miles per hour all day, more than enough to pick the cows up, slice them from the tips of their noses to the roots of their tails, and arrange their organs to spell out the word ‘soon.’ Evidently, the low dew point also caused them to glow a pale, eerie green color. Anyway, this is really an open-and-shut case of death by exposure, and we have extensive documents signed by ranking officers of the Strategic Air Command testifying to that effect.” At press time, Washington law enforcement urged citizens living in the area to stay indoors, focus on keeping warm, and check their family members for a 3-inch scar below their right clavicle.',\n",

Joes, Barbies, and stuffed animals,” whom he accused of committing “horrible crimes” against Americans as soon as no one is looking. “A lot of people don’t want me to talk about this, but I’m not afraid to speak the truth: Toys have infested our country and our very homes, posing an enormous danger to anyone who turns their back on them. These violent dolls and action figures put our loved ones at risk, and if Congress does not act, I will be forced to exercise my power as commander-in-chief and use military force to eliminate this deadly menace.” Trump also expressed concerns regarding the “death and destruction” caused by witches and other monsters that emerge from bedroom closets after the lights go out.',\n",

We’ve got a lot to get through, so as long as there isn’t a visible film on it or anything, we’ll probably just stamp it Grade A and put it on the shelves.” Perdue went on to add that when workers were done playing catch-up with the meat, they would move on to the estimated 600 million gallons of milk currently sitting in the USDA headquarters basement.',\n",

It’s our concern that a ceasefire won’t stop the leaders of the United States from using their political and religious power to oppress their citizens, and we’re particularly worried about their treatment of women. We’re committed to stopping terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a platform, and we just hope that the United States would show the same commitment.” The Taliban added that they were also troubled by America’s long history of interfering with human rights across the world by funding dangerous, violent groups such as the Nicaraguan Contras, Colombian paramilitary groups, and the Taliban.',\n",

It’s quite possible they also acquired decades of tax returns through an ingenious phishing technique in which they directly asked Americans to mail them these forms. In the meantime, we’re warning everyone to be cautious if someone claiming to be a government agent asks for their Social Security number because that’s likely exactly who they are.” The agency went on to suggest that every American take the safety precaution of immediately changing their Social Security number to something more secure.',\n",

Just the comments men would make on a woman’s appearance, comments that were considered ‘normal’ at the time, were jaw-droppingly horrendous.” Upon learning that her grandmother had said “no” to her grandfather five times before finally agreeing to go out with him, Boyer considered the possibility that her grandmother does not realize she is in fact telling #MeToo stories.',\n",

An entire generation could enjoy the stylings of, say, your Rolling Stones your James Taylors. But not since the late ’90s has the sheer number of available recordings been limited enough for any decently sized group of friends to have even one song in common. You and only you have actually heard your favorite rapper, rock group, jam band, DJ, singer–songwriter, electro-pop duo, or Kanye West. As far as we are able to determine, the last song heard by more than one person was Outkast’s ‘Hey Ya,’ which, in fact, had several hundred fans.” Alvine added that, by 2023, no two people will likely even be referring to the same tonal and rhythmic patterns as “music.”',\n",

It’s only right we see that they are put back in the care of the officer who originally apprehended, handcuffed, and detained them. We won’t rest until every immigrant child is back safely in the arms of the ICE agent they know best.” Vitiello went on to proudly state that hundreds of such reunions had already happened outside homes, schools, and places of worship across the country.',\n",

No one deserves to endure what you have been through.” Haspel further confirmed that the agency was now operating under the assumption that Zacarias Moussaoui acted alone in perpetrating the events of 9/11.',\n",

Moreover, supervisors who referred to their staff as ‘one big family’ were much more likely to keep loyal employees for years or even decades, in some cases retaining experienced and dedicated workers until just before their retirement benefits kicked in, at which point said workers were either laid off or pruned away during a sudden corporate relocation to the Midwest.” Mahoney’s team also found that companies which failed to circulate an end-of-year note were 87 percent more likely to shut down in the subsequent year.',\n",

Man, just thinking about me blathering on during the Sermon on the Mount, I totally get why Pontius Pilate wanted to crucify me.” Christ, who described his many miracles as “cringeworthy,” also conceded that He was still pretty proud of that time when He multiplied those fish and the loaves of bread.',\n",

Going, say, with a dramatically shorter length, was a struggle for many whose hairstyles had been in their family for countless years. Many felt as though they were trimming a part of themselves, but officials felt it was really in their best interest to assimilate with a bob or even a blunt cut.

It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch, the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time, Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves, as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur.',\n",

The controversial memo went on to question the personal loyalty of the first lady to the president, going so far as to suggest she was someone widely viewed as “untrustworthy” within the administration. Noting that Melania Trump had repeatedly complained about the first lady to White House chief of staff John Kelly, sources painted a portrait of an East Wing in disarray and in desperate need of a shake-up. The unprecedented call for the ouster of a first lady by Ms. Trump has fueled speculation that she enjoys a great deal of influence over her husband.

Indeed, there are only a select few who can handle the pressure of devoting one’s entire life, and the entirety of time’s existence, to being an all-powerful deity,” said lead researcher Gary Anderson, who noted several factors that contribute to students quitting the journey to Godhood, including cost-prohibitive internships, an inequitable gender breakdown, and the comparatively difficult job market for Supreme Beings. “In many cases, schools would try to entice students by claiming they’d be an all-knowing deity right after college, but graduates soon discover much harsher realities.

So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven’t been reached since the 1950s.” Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday.',\n",

Plus, we were so preoccupied with how to ensure that his death was painful that we weren’t spending any time plotting how to cause the most horrendous massacres possible, allowing scores of Yemenis attending weddings or traveling on school field trips to survive. Our focus on killing Mr. Khashoggi has granted hundreds of Yemenis the gift of life.” The crown prince added that the Saudis were prepared to save the lives of even more Yemenis if they could reallocate their resources to inflict mass starvation and a cholera epidemic on a few dissident journalists instead.',\n",

Which is great, because KIND was really struggling as a maker of particleboard furniture until someone figured out you could eat these things.” Lubetzky also revealed that six new strains of KIND bar have begun to materialize just in time for the holidays.',\n",

I saw no way we could ever compete with them Radiohead almost broke up completely,” said Yorke, revealing that the opening notes of Coldplay’s simple piano ballad ‘The Scientist’ frustrated him to tears when he realized that he would likely never create anything as sonically perfect. “Yes, we received some minor praise for Kid A and Amnesiac. But critics failed to realize that those albums were just vain attempts to compete with the gorgeously understated melodies and feather-light falsetto that made A Rush Of Blood To The Head so hauntingly beautiful. After that album came out, Jonny, our guitarist, called me in a panic and said we needed to get back in the studio immediately. Coldplay may not have put anything out recently, but I know that they’re just waiting, conserving their strength, preparing to release an incredible concept album and forever unseat us as the second coming of Pink Floyd. It might be enough if, just once, [undisputed genius singer-songwriter and spiritual heir to the musical and thematic legacies of Depeche Mode and Talking Heads] Chris [Martin] would say ‘good job, mate’ after I put out an album, but until then, I’ll try and take motivation from living in his incredibly long shadow.” Yorke added that, had it not been for Coldplay’s epic, genre-defining Super Bowl halftime show, he may never have considered bringing Radiohead’s music to large stadiums.',\n",

The nubless styrofoam cup has become the industry’s white whale,” said engineer Roberta Quinones, recounting hundreds of failed prototypes, forays into the use of experimental materials, and desperate attempts to simply remove the center nub, all of which ultimately rendered the cup completely unusable. “We’ve collaborated with some of the best engineers in the country, but no dice. We’ve found that, unfortunately, without the nub, the cups tend to simply fall apart in one’s hands. We aren’t sure of the nub’s exact function. We only know that, far from being a useless remnant like the human appendix, it seems absolutely integral to the cup itself. For my own peace of mind, I have to believe we’re getting closer and closer to a nub-free cup every day, but if you ask me for evidence to support that, well, you’ll be as disappointed as we are.” Quinones also solemnly thanked all the structural, materials sciences, and general beverage container engineers who have bravely laid down their lives for the cause.</p>',\n",

People need to focus less on their broad anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and look at the positive ideas these skinheads can bring to my future coalition government. For example, our ideological attitude toward Arabs aligns almost perfectly.” When reached for comment, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo was quick to say that the Trump administration would not take any position on the alliance during an Israeli election year.\\xa0</p>',\n",

Really? I’m sorry, but I’ll never forgive the Academy for that horseshit decision,” said New York resident Elliot Spencer, who echoed the near-unanimous sentiment of 323 million Americans in noting that not a day has gone by since the 1933 awards when he doesn’t find himself shaking with rage at the insult of depriving director Frank Capra the industry’s top honor and to instead reward such a paint-by-the-numbers, pandering piece of filmmaking. “The other day, I had a screaming match with a friend who said <em>Cavalcade</em> wasn’t really that bad. Seriously? I can’t think of a single greater injustice than seeing that hack Frank Lloyd onstage stealing Best Picture from Capra. God, I’m getting so fucking angry right now just remembering it.” At press time, the entire nation was stressing that they did think <em>Green Book</em> probably deserved to win this year.</p>',\n",

Has he ever thrown communion wine to the floor and called those receiving it deluded lotus eaters? No. We could never rely on this guy to storm into a packed worship service and dare the congregation’s imaginary God to strike him down while calling them all pawns in this sick little game of faith.” At press time, several members of the atheist community said they were “done with” Horvath after photographs came to light showing him smiling in a church during his brother’s wedding ceremony.</p>',\n",

While examining the fossilized specimen in our university’s Natural History Museum, we discovered we could actually pick it right up and hold it in our laps.” Haines also offered an apology to the museum, explaining that the T. rex’s bones were also far more delicate than previously believed and could in fact be inadvertently crushed in her bare hands.</p>',\n",

And of course, the supposed attack was immediately suspicious because nearly all violent crimes in this city end with a dead black man at the scene. So this was very much an open-and-shut case.” Johnson went on to state that it was a shame Smollett had taken on too much too soon and wasted his potential talent for covering up unlawful, self-serving behavior, as the young man could have had a bright future with the force.</p>',\n",

My whole family has it, so it’s likely genetic and not merely a chemical thing. My shitty home situation forced me to develop self-destructive coping mechanisms growing up.

Georgia</em> in the forced expulsion by the military of the Cherokee from their lands, the secret use of military advisors and support by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1953 Iranian coup d’état, and the recent precedent of extraneous invasions of other countries without the approval of Congress in violation of the War Powers Resolution by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. “Listen, folks, I would invite you to consult the history books, where you will see that posting troops at the border in the defense of an exaggerated claim that such security is needed to protect Americans is broadly in line with similar invasions, troop deployments, and other military activities throughout American history perpetuated to annex land, attack countries with governments not subservient to our country, or to further the interests of our client states. What I’m doing is entirely in keeping with the way that the U.S. government usually acts—time and time again, our leaders have ignored the basic conditions that would prompt acceptable military action, so why should this national emergency be treated differently? To this end, I would quote the words of Noam Chomsky, who said that ‘If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.’ I would additionally invite my critics to consult scholarly texts on William McKinley’s role in the annexation of the Philippines, the rationale used by Lyndon Johnson for ramping up troops in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon’s economic warfare in the 1973 Chilean coup, as I have, if they are interested in understanding why any accusation that I, as president, do not have historical precedent to back me up on this border security effort is without merit.” Trump also added that such precedents, as well as U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba, would give him more than sufficient historical justification for any similarly unprovoked, unilateral military action his administration may decide to undertake in Venezuela.</p>',\n",

Trump has shown that he won’t allow mere constitutional articles—not even the ones that explicitly delineate which powers are granted to which branches of government—to stop him from doing what he has pledged to do. That’s how tough he is.” Members of Trump’s base went on to urge the president to continue standing his ground by ignoring any future rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court that may seek to prevent him from fulfilling his campaign promises.</p>',\n",

I’m sure they all watched me skateboarding in my stylish sunglasses and envied the Flamin’ Hot lifestyle I lived on my TV show and in Sega Genesis games, but in reality, I was suffering, barely clinging onto life. I can’t take back the harm my actions have caused to the world’s children, but I promise them this: The harder Frito-Lay tries to sweep my condition under the rug, the harder I will fight. I refuse to be silenced.” Cheetah’s statement is the most severe mascot-related scandal to hit Frito-Lay since 1972, when the Frito Bandito was gunned down by treasury agents outside an El Paso currency exchange.</p>',\n",

Apart from our mountaintops, of course.

You’d find a military force friendly to American business interests, get them to slaughter anyone who wasn’t, and then dismiss the victims as communist guerillas. People were doing it all the time. It certainly didn’t stop anyone from letting me be assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs. Hell, I knew people who would make fun of you if you <em>hadn’t</em> committed a war crime or two.” Abrams went on to wax nostalgic about all the crazy late nights he spent with Lt. Col.

Man, you click on Hitler’s 1939 ‘Jewish Question’ speech to the Reichstag 48 times and all of a sudden it thinks that’s all you want to see.

This may be the only hot and steamy meal they get all week.” Noting that human contact was the most important part of the visit, Loxley added that volunteers were happy to stick around and put strawberry gummy G-strings in a blender or drip hot wax on the seniors’ genitals if they needed extra assistance.</p>',\n",

Conditions were really bad—there was a lot of drifting snow, and wind speeds fluctuated between 30 and 50 miles per hour all day, more than enough to pick the cows up, slice them from the tips of their noses to the roots of their tails, and arrange their organs to spell out the word ‘soon.’ Evidently, the low dew point also caused them to glow a pale, eerie green color. Anyway, this is really an open-and-shut case of death by exposure, and we have extensive documents signed by ranking officers of the Strategic Air Command testifying to that effect.” At press time, Washington law enforcement urged citizens living in the area to stay indoors, focus on keeping warm, and check their family members for a 3-inch scar below their right clavicle.</p>',\n",

No doubt many <em>National Geographic </em>readers will disagree with him, but in a changing world, we believe our discourse can only be enhanced with the inclusion of a talented writer who expresses a deep-rooted and unrelenting hatred for these animals.” Goldberg confirmed she was looking for additional ways to expand the magazine’s ideological diversity, noting that at least 90 percent of the current editorial staff still opposes the rapid mass extinction of species.</p>',\n",

No more planes, and no more delays caused by mechanical problems or the weather. Plus, your membership is good for five years.” At press time, sources confirmed several members of the new pre-check program had taken to social media to complain about the wait times they faced upon arrival on the tarmac.</p>',\n",

Virtually no one. Would I do it now? Of course not. I’d probably just go out and buy a chimp. Listen, I loved Michael Jackson, and I never meant to offend. It was supposed to be a tribute.” At press time, Northam claimed that he would have come clean about the pedophilia sooner had he not been so strung out on powerful sedatives.</p>',\n",

Thankfully, though, they represent just a tiny minority of Catholics.” Sources added that several popes have considered excommunicating the fringe sect from the Church entirely in order to eliminate their heretical belief of objecting to child molestation from gaining any more followers.</p>',\n",

I’m not calling off a run just yet, but I’ve got to consider the hard truth that my time to be the face of the Democratic Party may have passed.” Carter added that he had never forgiven Ted Kennedy for mounting a campaign against him in the 1980 primaries and handing the election to Reagan.</p>',\n",

Some believe the big chair made out of swords is a Bolton because it was spared during the Red Wedding, while others read its hunger for power as a Lannister trait. The trailer cuts away right before Daenerys is about to divulge the big secret, so you’ll just have to tune in to find out what happens next.” At press time, leaked footage from the upcoming series finale confirmed that, just moments before its identity is revealed, the sword-covered chair is melted down for scrap, leaving its identity a mystery forever.</p>',\n",

At this rate, he should be ready to reveal his findings about the first 96 hours of the Trump campaign by 2020.” Justice Department sources also cautioned people following the investigation not to get too excited about it ending with bombshell arrests, and estimated that it would likely lead to indictments for only 10-12 percent of the U.S. population.</p>',\n",

I didn’t start out to ask her about sexual harassment, but Jesus Christ—she just matter-of-fact told me some stuff that scared the shit out of me,” said Boyer, explaining that she was sickened to learn that a male coworker lifting up a woman’s skirt, a boss forcefully kissing a female employee at a holiday party, or a total stranger pinching a fellow restaurant patron’s rear end was a disturbingly regular occurrence during what 84-year-old Gwendolyn Boyer described, with obvious nostalgia, as her “heyday.” “Grandma rattled off a list of stuff that happened either to her or someone she knew, things we’d call stalking, intimidation, and full-on assault. Just the comments men would make on a woman’s appearance, comments that were considered ‘normal’ at the time, were jaw-droppingly horrendous.” Upon learning that her grandmother had said “no” to her grandfather five times before finally agreeing to go out with him, Boyer considered the possibility that her grandmother does not realize she is in fact telling #MeToo stories.</p>',\n",

An entire generation could enjoy the stylings of, say, your Rolling Stones your James Taylors. But not since the late ’90s has the sheer number of available recordings been limited enough for any decently sized group of friends to have even one song in common. You and only you have actually heard your favorite rapper, rock group, jam band, DJ, singer–songwriter, electro-pop duo, or Kanye West. As far as we are able to determine, the last song heard by more than one person was Outkast’s ‘Hey Ya,’ which, in fact, had several hundred fans.” Alvine added that, by 2023, no two people will likely even be referring to the same tonal and rhythmic patterns as “music.”</p>',\n",

I was raised Roman Catholic and attended the Roman Catholic School St. Anne’s. It’s hard to believe a child from such humble origins would end up making his living working for the president of the United States and ensuring that his reputation is protected at any cost—actually, sorry, let’s start over again.” At press time, Giuliani was halfway through his sixth straight retelling of the events of his toddler years.</p>',\n",

A separate rift has emerged over whether it makes any difference if the noise in question is being produced by a single person with a hand drum or a large drum circle beating away on djembes.” At press time, a spokesperson for the Native American Arts Council told reporters that U.S. residents who object to drumming in public are welcome to withdraw from their settlements and move to another continent.</p>',\n",

Not only will this cut campaign-related expenses by up to $20 million, it will also allow inmates to spend time in the community and provide them with valuable work-related opportunities.” Harris added that due to a quirk in California state law, most inmates would be ineligible to work for other political campaigns once they’d been released from prison.</p>',\n",

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) confirmed Tuesday that his 1983 vote against making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a national holiday was cast after anticipating that the country would sanitize and dishonor the leader’s memory. “Way back in the ’80s, I already knew MLK Day would just be the first step by the powers that be to recast Dr. King’s radical civil disobedience as some sort of bland and ineffective centrism,” said Grassley, who stressed that his greatest fear while voting was that there would come a day when politicians and corporations appropriated the famed activist’s image for crass self-promotion. “My sole motivation here was preventing the kind of future where people only pay lip service to some commercialized version of Dr. King without ever taking the time to truly understand his revolutionary vision. And yet here we are, in a world where the FBI is actually tweeting about him like the COINTELPRO surveillance operation never happened. What a travesty.” Grassley also noted he had only stayed silent on the issue since the vote because he believed anything anyone could possibly say about the famed orator and Baptist minister had already been said better by the great man himself.</p>',\n",

Despite the years-long drought that has scourged the countryside and left its once-fruitful fields bereft of greenery, Her Majesty has decreed that she will not look mercifully upon any subject who cannot render annual tribute amounting to one-10th of his harvest, though their starveling children cry themselves to sleep and the ribs of their horses cast sawtoothed shadows on the withered heath. Queen Elizabeth, characteristically stony of countenance in the face of the regrettable but necessary punitive ceremony, was observed to betray the merest hint of expression only once, the ghost of a smile flitting across her divinely blessed face as the delinquent farmer’s joints ground free of their gristly moorings, separating from their groaning sockets with a sharp report not unlike that of a brass nine-pounder cannonade and nearly drowning out the peasant’s high, keening screams. In the final moments of the excruciation, Her Majesty was seen to evince a slight gesture to the Royal Oxherd, entreating that officiant to whip the oxen more stoutly, that the farmer be delivered without any more suffering than necessary to make the Crown’s displeasure known, and that the Royal Fusiliers might waste no time in relieving the miserable ploughman of his head, which was duly placed upon a spike above the gate to Buckingham Palace as fair warning to all who would dodge the tax. Before Her Majesty reportedly retired, satisfied, to the Palace, the Royal Chamberlain let it be known that the Queen, in her infinite wisdom and compassion, declared that families who have been visited by undue hardship may, in lieu of drawing and quartering, offer up their first-born son to be pressed into service with the Royal Navy.</p>',\n",

So we decided to just spend a quiet evening taking in the Happily Ever After fireworks show like we’ve done thousands of times before, but we could barely make our way through Frontierland without practically running over some out-of-towner snapping photos.” Dugas reportedly took some comfort in the fact that if she wanted to avoid tourists altogether, she could always head on over to SeaWorld.</p>',\n",

Some of them are even living in environments where they never see any law enforcement agents at all, let alone heavily armed officers in body armor. It’s only right we see that they are put back in the care of the officer who originally apprehended, handcuffed, and detained them. We won’t rest until every immigrant child is back safely in the arms of the ICE agent they know best.” Vitiello went on to proudly state that hundreds of such reunions had already happened outside homes, schools, and places of worship across the country.</p>',\n",

I guess I just imagined her with a clear plastic bin—one featuring handles in which everything is visible, the contents arranged to stand vertically—but seeing her with that loose-hinged disaster just makes me feel like the magic of tidying up is nothing but a big lie.” More forgiving fans theorized that perhaps the cabinet did indeed at one point spark joy within Kondo, and that she simply may not yet be ready to thank the dilapidated cabinet for its service and toss it aside.</p>',\n",

Instead of suppressing his emotions about major issues in his life, he cries at sad commercials. Our fights used to be him screaming at me for a few minutes and that was it, not great but not terrible. Then last night, we get into an argument that somehow turns into me nodding and making comforting noises while he talks about his strained relationship with his dad until well after midnight.

And the more he continues to foist blame on others, the deeper the animus against him will grow.

The cowlicks, the whorls, the tufts—they’re everywhere!” veteran Bosley hair restoration surgeon Dr. Michael Pittz can be heard to say on fragmented operating room footage recorded seconds before he and his entire team of restoration specialists were crushed by runaway dark-brown locks. The restored hair, which normally grows to satisfactory thickness over the course four to six weeks, flooded the operating room before enveloping all of Los Angeles within 20 minutes then shaking itself out luxuriantly up and down the west coast, sweeping its shimmering locks across America’s heartland, and finally making a thick, glossy wasteland of the Appalachian mountain region. At press time, Bosley technicians were injecting Richards’ continent-spanning hair with DHT hormones that cause male pattern baldness, though it was too early to tell if this last-ditch measure would be enough to save the remaining Americans from the swells of enviable, natural-looking hair.</p>',\n",

Moreover, supervisors who referred to their staff as ‘one big family’ were much more likely to keep loyal employees for years or even decades, in some cases retaining experienced and dedicated workers until just before their retirement benefits kicked in, at which point said workers were either laid off or pruned away during a sudden corporate relocation to the Midwest.” Mahoney’s team also found that companies which failed to circulate an end-of-year note were 87 percent more likely to shut down in the subsequent year.\\xa0</p>',\n",

That changed after Pearl Harbor,” said researcher Bethany Karl, explaining that at the war’s outset, manufacturers of munitions turned to pets to fill jobs at factories and shipyards vacated by men leaving to enlist. “This exhibit contains hundreds of hours of previously unscreened film documenting cats riveting together fighter planes at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory 31, dogs pulling M4 Sherman frames down the line at the Lima Tank Works, and parrots delivering vital communications at the labyrinthian Charlestown Army Ammunition Plant. During the war, these animals proved capable of anything their owners could do, transforming forever their place in American society.” Karl noted that budgetary issues had forced Smithsonian officials to cancel a small addendum to the exhibit focusing on the brutal 1946 beating of hundreds of dogs, cats, and other companion animals during their ill-fated postwar attempt to unionize.</p>',\n",

It is a trauma that will stay with me for the rest of my life.” At press time, Coltrane was reportedly on the verge of a panic attack after receiving orders to redeploy to the border in advance of the 2020 elections.</p>',\n",

Well, that was yesterday—we got an eight-point buck jacked to the gills on PEDs to blow those fucking kittycats right out of the water,” said wildlife biologist Dr. Richard McCann, whose 18-month research project and high-intensity fast-twitch-fiber-building synthetic hormone project has proven his theory that a deer whose testosterone output was increased by a factor of 30 could potentially break the national interstate speed limit. “The <em>Odocoileus virginianus </em>was never forced to evolve outright speed as a means of catching prey like the pronghorn or the wildebeest, so it maxed out around 30 mph. But once we got this little guy juicing, his hind legs alone gained over 40 pounds of pure muscle mass with less than 1 percent body fat.

The vibe was super weird because nobody seemed to know anybody else. What was Kevin thinking? There’s a guy here I dumped in high school. And he completely left out Sophia, my best friend.

Climate change is a global issue, so the time is now for animals to do their part to help protect the environment, and that means cows working to offset their carbon footprint, birds cutting down on excess travel, and fish having fewer children. We also urge animals to become more politically involved by contacting their member of Congress and demand the government focus on regulatory measures and promoting renewable technology—consider writing a letter to your representative.” Researchers followed up their advice to animals with several recommendations for plants that aren’t currently doing enough to fight climate change.</p>',\n",

While no animals were physically harmed in our testing process, many were made to feel confused and uncomfortable after being forced to wear the wrong prescription, or a set of heavy frames that totally overwhelmed their face shape, and for that we can never apologize enough. No defenseless creature should ever be forced to try on the Fletcher, the Percey, the Tansley, the Tate, or any other Warby Parker design.” A statement from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals acknowledged the apology and reiterated that animals should never be used in such tests, even if many kittens and puppies do look “pretty fucking adorable” in glasses.</p>',\n",

It seemed like she only wanted us to get back together for a couple weeks before completely moving on. We never would, not in a million years, but I sort of wish she wanted it more than she wants a Lego pirate ship.” Ferguson also noted that Kayla had selfishly failed to ask Santa for her recently deceased grandmother to come back to life.<br/></p>',\n",

Really get that thing glowing hot. As far as we know, this is how all great chemists discovered their passion for lab work.” Holbrook declared his approach a qualified success after his students became sufficiently interested in science to ignite a hydrogen-filled balloon, burning down the school laboratory.</p>',\n",

Going, say, with a dramatically shorter length, was a struggle for many whose hairstyles had been in their family for countless years. Many felt as though they were trimming a part of themselves, but officials felt it was really in their best interest to assimilate with a bob or even a blunt cut.

Hell, just yesterday I noticed something called an ‘overage reduction.’ Seriously, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Do I owe them money or do they owe me? It’s maddening. All I can say is that some of the numbers in this bill don’t make sense in Euclidean or non- Euclidean space. It may well be unsolvable.” Acknowledging the limitations of modern science, Schmidt suggested that further inspection of the document perhaps be handled by a devotee of the occult.</p>',\n",

Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers, law enforcement, and other authorities to control other, less powerful people by causing them severe pain, so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us. We just want to stress that our intended use for tear gas, whether it’s to disperse peaceful activists or to assault crowds of migrants, could not be any closer to what these products were actually used for.” The nation’s tear gas manufacturers added that critics of their products consistently failed to appreciate the care that they took to ensure that tear gas was not supposed to be lethal.</p>',\n",

It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch, the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time, Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves, as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur.</p>',\n",

I mean, what the fuck, there was a dog or something?” Millet, like most American readers of popular fiction, confessed that his degenerate, coke-damaged reading habits might well have persisted into the 1990s had he not experienced a personal epiphany upon being hit by a van.</p>',\n",

Could be Phoenician, really. We’ll have to check. At any rate, it shares many of the same basic characteristics as other vases in our possession, distinguishing itself through slight differences that you no doubt will be easily able to discern,” said museum director and CEO Daniel Weiss, noting that the ceramic piece would be placed on display in the passageway between the “Interminable and Labyrinthian Galleries of Asian Art” and “Stacks and Stacks of Musical Instruments” wings. “We look forward to our visitors spending 10 or 12 seconds blinking at this excellent example of a vase, and perhaps even reading its placard in the hope of learning something uniquely interesting about it, but most likely it will simply read ‘vase’ and list a general time period for its creation.” The Met also took the opportunity to announce the acquisition of a bunch more old coins.</p>',\n",

I know, I know, everyone says motherhood changes a person, but until I finally clutched her close to my chest, I didn’t realize how true it was. And now this little one’s all mine.” Knott has yet to decide on a name, but was strongly leaning towards “Autumn” after hiding overnight with her baby in a pile of leaves.</p>',\n",

We regret our actions, and we regret further compromising this discovery by destroying the Neanderthal’s tools, personal possessions, and, indeed, all trace of his culture in a frenzy of homicidal rage. Our behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable. We apologize to the Smithsonian, to our backers, and to the scientific community at large. You deserve better.” At press time, the numerous photos taken of the Neanderthal had been lost after those assembled began emitting guttural war whoops and swarming around the camera to smash it with rocks.</p>',\n",

But we cannot rest on our laurels; public schools are the first experience most children have with American society, and it’s crucial that we continue to instill a sense of normalized incompetence and apathy in our young people. It’s our duty as American citizens prepare them for lives of boundless mediocrity.” However, at press time, Cunningham admitted that a false sense of meaningfulness and individual worth from sources such as music, literature, the arts, and even mental health counseling were still major concerns in some of the nation’s wealthiest public school districts.</p>',\n",

So remember, if you have a tampon, please dispose of it properly and safely by finding a trash can, rather than creating an environmental disaster.” Ling also confirmed the gargantuan tampon is responsible for the deaths of 15 cats and dogs that were reported missing last week.</p>',\n",

We urge her not to indulge in blatant partisan behavior by manipulating the system so that all the votes are counted, and to do the honorable thing by giving up her candidacy.” Georgia GOP officials added that residents could avoid abetting Abrams’ compromised position by not voting for her in a runoff election.\\xa0</p>',\n",

This is a huge breakthrough in the field of nutrition, and we highly recommend people adopt the lifestyle before they fall victim to it.” Haugen went on to speculate that, if a person was fully committed to the Mediterranean diet, it may be possible for them to draw enough life force from the Earth’s population to achieve immortality.</p>',\n",

I’m not really that familiar with the Wyoming governor’s race, and I have no idea which of these Michigan judges to vote for,” said McDonough, who said the two candidates to represent his North Carolina district in Congress were listed as being a Nebraska Republican and a New Hampshire Democrat. “I’m definitely voting yes on this ballot measure to legalize marijuana in North Dakota, but I’m not sure about approving a tax hike for this bridge in Mississippi. Maybe I’ll just play it safe and vote straight party-line for city council in Pittsburgh, Lubbock, and Anchorage.” At press time, a judge had upheld the legality of McDonough’s congressional district, which covers an acre-wide strip of land zig-zagging across the country.</p>',\n",

It’s an uphill battle, of course, but who knows if those polls really capture the enthusiasm of voters out there, like the campaign sign of mine that one of my volunteers saw on someone’s lawn a few weeks ago. And if I can pull in .3 percent or even .4 percent of absentee ballots, I think we’re looking at really exceeding the pollsters’ expectations.” At press time, Booth and his three-person campaign staff were wondering if the election could tip their way after learning that early voting tallies had netted the candidate four votes.</p>',\n",

We’re past believing the empty promises of politicians, and we will not be satisfied until real, concrete action is taken. Also, we will not be satisfied that a muffin or pancake counts as a pastry—we want some sort of real dessert early in the day, and we want it now.” Nelson added that if it came down to it, they’d settle for just the breakfast dessert.</p>',\n",

So, if someone could please just close down the polls until after the holidays, it would really be appreciated.” At press time, the nation added that it would even be fine to push midterms as far back as 2020 because they already knew the current sitting president was just going to get reelected anyways.\\xa0</p>',\n",

It’s only reasonable, or else we wouldn’t have paid to continuously bomb your country for nine years straight in the first place. Frankly, the fact that 34,000 of your men, women, and children have set off American cluster munitions since the war ended without the U.S. government receiving so much as a penny of recompense is unacceptable.” The invoice reportedly ended by insisting that, if Laos fails to act soon, the United States will also be forced to charge the country for the millions of tons of munitions that effectively exploded during the war.</p>',\n",

I mean, she works in the service industry—how much money do they think she makes?” said local woman Heather Schultz of the spacious and immaculate New York City mug supposedly owned by the 24-year-old character. “I get that not every detail can be 100 percent accurate, but things like this just take me out of the show completely. I mean, I have some friends in New York, and none of their mugs are even close to that big.

For many women, it’s important for them to know that all of humanity is relying on them to keep the species alive before making the commitment to become a mother.” The report also explained that many women are waiting to get married until they can leverage the union into an alliance with the powerful warlord of a post-apocalyptic nomadic tribe.</p>',\n",

So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven’t been reached since the 1950s.” Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday.</p>',\n",

Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.</p>',\n",

The buildup of gas can be slow, as carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air, so it may go unnoticed the entire morning.

It is an absolute shame that the worldwide Jewish plot failed to telepathically communicate the imminent danger to the people in the building, or use their minds to erect an invisible, impenetrable barrier around the entire synagogue.” Trump ended his speech by calling for unity in the worldwide Jewish conspiracy to prevent future anti-Semitic hate crimes with their mystical powers.</p>',\n",

Countless people have lost many years of their lives, missing important events such as loved ones’ birthdays, weddings, and funerals to instead stand in line behind five to six other customers.

The problem is probably made worse by the fact that many clouds seem so soft and fluffy.” Levin and her team hope that their study of bird deaths will help scientists understand why half of airline flights crash every year.</p>',\n",

The worst damage, however, came from a henchman’s parachute getting sucked into the engine.

I saw no way we could ever compete with them—Radiohead almost broke up completely,” said Yorke, revealing that the opening notes of Coldplay’s simple piano ballad ‘The Scientist’ frustrated him to tears when he realized that he would likely never create anything as sonically perfect. “Yes, we received some minor praise for <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em>.

       " '<p>TULSA, OK—Saying that the admission represented a momentous new step in their relationship, advertising salesman Vince Fergus, 26, confirmed Wednesday that his “kinky” girlfriend had expressed interest in experiencing sexual pleasure later tonight. “I mean, I guess I’m game for whatever, but I just never thought of Jessie as the type of girl who would be into that sort of thing. She’s always seemed so normal and straight-laced,” said Fergus, who confessed he’d never experimented with providing sexual pleasure for any of his previous girlfriends, but insisted he was “down to experiment” and would be willing to broaden his physical horizons with his current partner as long as it was done carefully and with respect. “Honestly? I don’t know where she even found out about this stuff. She must have read something about it online. Of course I trust her, but I’m a little nervous—one of my buddies said he tried this type of thing with his girlfriend once, and it was kind of freaky and gross. They broke up right after that.” Fergus was later overheard admitting that his stomach dropped when his girlfriend added she’d also be interested in experimenting with foreplay.</p>',\n",
       " '<p>LOS ANGELES—Discussing how narrative cohesion would be maintained in the new sitcom, the showrunner of the upcoming <em>Roseanne</em> spinoff told reporters Tuesday that he hoped the giant puddle of blood in the set’s kitchen would adequately explain the former main character’s absence. “Sure, we could have had one of the many remaining characters just come out and explain what happened to Roseanne, but we have too much respect for our audience to spoon-feed them the storyline that way,” said <em>Conners</em> executive producer Bruce Helford of the bright red puddle of prop blood that is shown spreading across the titular family’s linoleum kitchen floor in the first episode of the new series. “As it happens, if you listen closely, you should be able to tell exactly what we’re going for with the blood. At one point in the script, D.J. says, ‘It’s a shame what happened to Mom,’ while pointing at the puddle. We also have Jackie referring to the puddle as ‘Roseanne’ in a couple scenes. Hopefully that will do the trick.” Sources confirmed that before the show taped, Helford ordered a set dresser to drop a few tufts of brown hair to the puddle for added realism.</p>',\n",
       " '<p>ROCKFORD, IL—Saying that the jovial drawing will forever signify their bond of goodwill, local father Gary Ericson confirmed Tuesday that a smiley face doodled on their Buffalo Wild Wings meal check commemorates the undeniable chemistry between their waiter and the Ericson family. “Ever since Jason introduced himself by name and asked if he could start us off with anything to drink, I knew we had a connection,” said Ericson, recalling their server’s warm greeting, enthusiastic recommendation of the passion fruit iced tea, and frequent visits to the table to inquire as to how everything was going so far, all demonstrating a deep personal commitment and the foundation for what shall surely be a lifelong friendship. “The way he reacted when, after he asked how we had enjoyed our food, and I claimed it was terrible—even though I’d already finished all my wings? You don’t get that sort of delighted laughter from anyone but a bosom friend. And now, this smiley face stands forever as symbol of and monument to that very friendship.” Ericson sealed the eternal bond between Jason and his clan by leaving a 10 percent tip.</p>',\n",
       " '<p>NASHVILLE, TN—Hastily shooing away the varmints with corn whisk brooms, members of the Tennessee State Election Commission reportedly drove a pack of wild animals out of local voting booths Tuesday in preparation for the upcoming midterm election. “Y’all critters ain’t welcome in this here polling place—go on, get!” said commission member Greg Duckett, using a garden hose to remove a thick accumulation of spiderwebs from an electronic voting machine that, according to reports, has also been home to a small family of raccoons since the 2016 general election. “I don’t know how we’re gonna get all these voting booths gussied up by Nov. 6. At this point, I’ve swept more squirrel nests out of ballot boxes than I can rightly count. I reckon we may just have to leave the rodents be and focus on rounding up the possums.” At press time, sources confirmed the commission had finished chasing out most of the wild animals and voted to begin shooing away minority voters.</p>',\n",
       " '<p>RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA—In a press conference ahead of a meeting with U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman admitted Tuesday that journalist Jamal Khashoggi died during a botched assassination attempt. “We lured Mr. Khashoggi to our consulate in Turkey for what was supposed to be a straightforward, routine execution, but things went off the rails at some point during the torture portion, and he accidentally bled out,” said the crown prince, adding that under normal circumstances, journalists who negatively portray the Saudi regime are eliminated efficiently and without international uproar. “We offer our sincere apologies to the Khashoggi family for mishandling Jamal’s slaughter. This should have been a quick in-and-out death and dismemberment situation, not the drawn-out, hours-long bloodbath it turned into. We flubbed this one big time.” The crown prince also assured journalists that Saudi leaders plan to implement new murder guidelines to standardize future assassinations and reduce instances of bungled hits.</p>']"

       "'PALO ALTO, CA Frustrated at their lack of progress in the fields of disposable drinking vessel design and production, engineers at Function Engineering, Inc. confirmed Thursday that they are as yet unable to produce a styrofoam cup without the little center nub sticking out from the bottom. “This team, and dozens of teams before them, have worked on this challenge for over four decades without cracking it. The nubless styrofoam cup has become the industry’s white whale,” said engineer Roberta Quinones, recounting hundreds of failed prototypes, forays into the use of experimental materials, and desperate attempts to simply remove the center nub, all of which ultimately rendered the cup completely unusable. “We’ve collaborated with some of the best engineers in the country, but no dice. We’ve found that, unfortunately, without the nub, the cups tend to simply fall apart in one’s hands. We aren’t sure of the nub’s exact function. We only know that, far from being a useless remnant like the human appendix, it seems absolutely integral to the cup itself. For my own peace of mind, I have to believe we’re getting closer and closer to a nub-free cup every day, but if you ask me for evidence to support that, well, you’ll be as disappointed as we are.” Quinones also solemnly thanked all the structural, materials sciences, and general beverage container engineers who have bravely laid down their lives for the cause.'"
